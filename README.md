## Your Kubernetes Clusters Are NOT Secure
Wild guess, you've been told you have to run Kubernetes, but don't quite know where to start right? This repo is meant as a way to help you secure your cluster in the more efficient COST EFFECTIVE way. There are plenty of solutions that will secure your Kubernetes clusters, but this is for you to start with before talking to those groups. 

I am also open to feedback and pull requests from other K8s practitioners. This is meant to help those in need.
